; General settings control basic behavior of the plugin
;
; * cacheConfig - set to true to cache the parsed configuration data
;   so it doesn't get parsed on each request.
; Default cache engine is file to change cacheconfig to Redis or any other Engine, 
; Add follwing Cache config in your core.php or bootstrap.php 
; Cache::config('asset_compress',array(
; 'engine'      => 'Redis',
; 'host'        => 'redis_host_ip',
; 'port'        => 'redis_port', 
; 'duration'    => 'duration of keys to be stored', 
; ));
; for more details on caching, refer https://book.cakephp.org/2.0/en/core-libraries/caching.html

; * alwaysEnableController - Set to true to always enable the
;   AssetsController. Generally you will want to disable the controller
;   in production, as it could allow an attacker to request expensive
;   resources repeatedly. However, if you need the controller available
;   in production. You can enable this flag.
;

; * timestamp - Set to true to add a timestamp to build files.
; * paths - An array of paths where files used in builds can be found

; * baseUrl - Set the base url this type of asset is served off of, good
;   for using with CDN's
