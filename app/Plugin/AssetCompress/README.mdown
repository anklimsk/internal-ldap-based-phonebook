# Asset Compress

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/markstory/asset_compress.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/markstory/asset_compress)

Asset Compress is CakePHP plugin for helping reduce the number of requests, and optimizing the remaining requests your application makes for Javascript and CSS files.

### Features

* Development mode builder that rebuilds assets on each request.
* Command line build tool to compile static assets for deployment.
* Built-in support for LESScss, Sass and CoffeeScript, as well as several
  minifiers.
* Powerful and flexible filter system allowing you to add your own
  minifiers/pre-processors.
* Simple configuration file.
* Incremental builds that don't recompile assets when they don't need to
  be.

## Installing

Clone or download the plugin into one of your plugin paths. Then make
sure you load the plugin:

	// in app/Config/bootstrap.php
	CakePlugin::load('AssetCompress', array('bootstrap' => true));

You should make sure to load the plugin **after** configuring other
dispatcher filters as the following will replace the configuration
added by AssetCompress. For example using the default bootstrap.php, you
should end up with something like:

	// in app/Config/bootstrap.php
	Configure::write('Dispatcher.filters', array(
		'AssetDispatcher',
		'CacheDispatcher'
	));
	CakePlugin::load('AssetCompress', array('bootstrap' => true));

Copy the `Config/asset_compress.sample.ini` to `App/Config/asset_compress.ini`. From there
read the [wiki](http://github.com/markstory/asset_compress/wiki) for more information.
