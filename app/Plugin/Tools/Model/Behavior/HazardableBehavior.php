/**
 * Uses the HazardLib to test well known injection snippets of all kinds (including XSS, SQL)
 * and tests your db wrapper methods or populates your records with it.
 * Use this ONLY for testing environments and never on your live data.
 *
 * Available snippet types are XSS, PHP and SQL.
 *
 * The main concern is not just "eval" users that might try to hijack/abuse your site.
 * Not properly securing your view also means that strings like `some>cool<string` will most likely mess up your HTML.
 * The view could be rendered as a complete mess without the user or the developer knowing it. It might have even been
 * the admin which inserted those layout-breaking strings, after all.
 * That's why it is so important to follow the rule "do NOT sanitize, validate input, escape output" (there are exceptions, of course).
 * Also make sure, you already cover those basics in your baking template. This will save a lot of time in the long run.
 *
 * If you inserted records go and browse your backend and especially your frontend.
 * Everywhere where you get some alert or strange behavior, you might have forgotten to use h() or other
 * measures to secure your output properly.
 *
 * You can also apply this behavior globally to overwrite all strings in your application temporarily.
 * This way you don't need to modify the database. On output it will just inject the hazardous strings and
 * you can browse your website just as if they were actually stored in your db.
 *
 * Add it to some models or even the AppModel (temporarily!) as `$actsAs = array('Tools.Hazardable'))`.
 * A known limitation of Cake behaviors is, though, that this would only apply for first-level records (not related data).
 * So it is usually better to insert some hazardous strings into all your tables and make your tests then as closely
 * to the reality as possible.
